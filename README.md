This framework has been developed using the Cucumber BDD format, with API steps covering POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE services. TestNG assertions are used to validate responses.

How to Run the Feature File:

1.Open the restapi.feature file.
2.Click the play button to execute the tests.
    
Note: You may frequently encounter a 429 Too Many Requests response for all the APIs due to rate limiting. To avoid this issue, please run each method separately by commenting out the other steps in the feature file while running.
